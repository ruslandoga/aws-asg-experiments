- ~~try autoscaling group with/without lb config, can still use lb health checks?~~ no, even though ELB shows enabled
- ~~register with lb~~ that ...
- ~~register/deregister with lb in app startup/shutdown~~ ... and that are no longer relevant
- ~~register/deregister, turn off nginx, does still mark unhealthy?~~ yes, but with a long delay
- ~~deregister, do requests still go to that instance?~~ yes, even with 0s deregistration delay

- script ssh restarts

```sh
> mix deploy
# lists instances
# connects to each in turn
# deregisters the instance from elb
# updates nginx conf
# systemctl restart nginx
# registers the instance with elb
```

- try it in container
- try it in container managed by systemd (podman,type=fork), as good as type=notify?
- bench against uncontainerized

```ini
```
